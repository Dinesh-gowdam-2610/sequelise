Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Sequelize helps you interact with your database by abstracting the SQL queries into JavaScript-based methods. It allows you to work with your database using objects and methods.

Node.js: Sequelize is designed to work with Node.js, making it a popular choice for developers building applications with Node.js on the server side.

Relational Databases: Sequelize supports multiple relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. It provides a consistent API for working with these databases.

Models: Sequelize uses the concept of models to represent database tables. Each model corresponds to a table, and instances of the model represent rows in that table.

Migrations: Sequelize includes a migration system that allows you to make changes to your database schema over time. This is useful for versioning and managing database changes.

Hooks:
Sequelize supports hooks, which are functions that are called before or after certain actions, such as beforeCreate, beforeUpdate, afterCreate, etc.

Transactions:
Transactions in Sequelize enable you to perform multiple operations as a single unit. This is crucial for ensuring the consistency of your database.

Validation:
Sequelize supports built-in validation for model attributes, allowing you to enforce data integrity.

Raw Queries:
While Sequelize provides a high-level API for most operations, you can also execute raw SQL queries when needed.

Middleware:
Sequelize middleware allows you to extend and customize the behavior of models.

Data Types:
Sequelize supports various data types, including STRING, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, TEXT, DATE, etc.

To start the server just type : npm start ( In the package.json modified with the index.js file )
